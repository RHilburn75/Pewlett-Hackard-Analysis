# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Project Overview
  Bobby and I colaborated on a project analysis for Pewlett - Hakard, using SQL.  Due to the success of both our analysis and colaboration, we have been tasked to 2 more assignments.  With the upcoming "silver tsunami" upont eh company, we have been task to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and to identify employees who will be eligible for the mentorship program.  The company needs the information to proactively plan against the surge of workers that will be retiring in the next few years.  This information will be used to ID open positions, training for associates and to ensure a seemless transition.  In order to do this we'll lay out the following:
 
  1. ID the retiring employees by title
  2. Determine the number of retiring employees department and title.
  3. Who will be eligible for the mentorship program.
  4. Define the number of employees heading towards retirement, who can provide mentoring to our up and coming associates by title and department.
  5. What roles need to be filled by title and separtment
 
## Results
1. ID the retiring employees by title
    - The table (listed below) was used in identifying the number of retiring employees.  this list includes, employee number, name (first and last), title, from date, and to date.
    - The file was quite extensive but looking at the snapshot of the table, it shows the same person more than once. Multiple lines for the same person reporesents multiple jobs the asscoiate had during their tenure at PH.
    - This table is the full list of employees that will be retiring soon.











Summary
- Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
